				<p>I'm Kevin O'Brien and this is my playground as I learn more about HTML5, CSS, and JS</p>
				<p>I grew up in a Navy family and moved around quite a bit. I attended schools in 2 states and one foreign country.</p>
				<p>Once I graduated high school, I attended and graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a degree in Chemistry. The plan was to become a forensic scientist however I decided to go a different direction.</p>
				<p>Once I graduated, I used my love of computers to become a help desk technician at E! Entertainment Television.  While working there, I learn system administration and UNIX.  Over time, I worked my way up and now manage a team of engineers at Amazon.</p>
